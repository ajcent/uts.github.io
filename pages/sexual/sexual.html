                and evaluating one's own sexual thoughts, desires, and
                behaviors. College students often do this to better understand
                their own motivations and preferences, including assessing how
                they perform sexually and whether they fit societal
                expectations. However, obsessively monitoring can lead to
                anxiety and becoming overly focused on sex. If this becomes
                distressing or harmful, it's important for individuals to seek
                help from a mental health professional.
