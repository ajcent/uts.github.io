          <h3>Physical Self</h3>
          <p>
            Sanjay Singh describes the Physical Self as the
            <strong> tangible and observable </strong> part of a person. This
            refers to our body and how we look. It is influenced by both
            biological factors and the environment. This aspect of ourselves can
            be further improved and developed.

          Your physical self plays a crucial role in how you understand
          yourself. It encompasses your body, appearance, emotions, and
          abilities. One way it shapes your understanding is through body image,
          which affects how you see and feel about your body, and impacts your
          confidence and self-esteem. Body image is influenced by societal
          beauty standards, cultural values, and personal experiences. Your
          physical abilities, like strength and coordination, also shape how you
          perceive yourself and your identity. Engaging in physical activities
          and improving performance can boost self-confidence and create a
          positive self-image.
        </p>
        <p class="understanding__text">
          Moreover, your physical self is connected to sensory experiences like
          touch, sight, taste, smell, and sound. These experiences shape how you
          perceive the world and your place in it. They also influence your
          emotions and interactions with the environment. Taking care of your
          physical health is important since physical ailments or chronic
          conditions can impact your self-perception and how you engage with the
          world. Maintaining good physical health contributes to a positive
          self-perception and overall well-being.
        </p>
        <p class="understanding__text">
          Furthermore, your appearance affects your social interactions and how
          others perceive you. Society often places a strong emphasis on
          physical attractiveness, and this can lead to self-consciousness and
          influence your self-image and self-esteem. Your physical appearance
          also influences first impressions, opportunities, and social
          interactions, highlighting the social aspect of your physical self.

              Do not be afraid to contact healthcare providers on campus or in
              your neighborhood if you have any physical health issues. They can
              offer advice, encouragement, and tools to assist your continued
              physical well-being.
